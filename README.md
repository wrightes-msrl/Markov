# Markov
Matlab examples related to discrete time Markov Models. Taken from "Probability Models for Data Analysis"

**markovEquilibrium.mlx:** MATLAB LiveScript that demonstrates how to define
a discrete time Markov model and empirically investigate its equilibrium state
distribution.

**markovEquilibrium.m:** MATLAB script that performs the same functionality
as markovEquilibrium.mlx.

**markovSimulation.mlx:** MATLAB LiveScript that demonstrates how to simulate
a time series of observations that could be modeled as a discrete time Markov
chain.

**markovSimulation.m:** MATLAB script that performs the same functionality as
markovSimulation.mlx.

**markovCalibration.mlx:** MATLAB LiveScript that demonstrates how to estimate
the transition probabilities for a discrete time Markov model from a time series
of observations that are believed to be described by that model.

**markovCalibration.m:** Matlab script that performs the same functionality as
markovCalibration.mlx.
